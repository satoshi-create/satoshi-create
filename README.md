## Hi there 👋

「横スクロールで楽しむ絵巻物」というサイトの構築に情熱を注いでいます。このプロジェクトにより、絵巻物を本来の見方で閲覧することを可能にし、UI＆UXを向上させること感じています。このプロジェクトを通じ、React.js、Next.jsなどモダンフレームワークに多くの知見を得ました。

We have created a website titled "Enjoy scrolling horizontally through picture scrolls". I feel that this project will improve the UI & UX by allowing visitors to view emaki scrolls the way they are meant to be viewed. Through this project, I have gained a lot of knowledge in modern frameworks such as React.js and Next.js.
