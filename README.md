# 👋 Hi, I'm Sato

I build **CANW** — an open-source project exploring cultural and ecological complexity through AI, storytelling, and network design.

- 🌱 I bridge frontend code and cultural knowledge  
- 🧠 I use OSS tools to model and visualize complexity  
- 🎴 I reimagine emaki, shrines, and Jomon heritage through generative AI

## 🧰 Favorite Tools

Next.js / TypeScript / NetworkX / Mermaid / Supabase / Figma /
